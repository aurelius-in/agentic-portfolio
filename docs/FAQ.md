# Portfolio FAQ

**What is this repository?**  
A centralized, skimmable index of my agentic AI projects with architecture one-pagers and UI previews showcasing my full-stack and agentic AI expertise.

**Are these production-ready?**  
They are production-style exemplars with deployability and observability patterns. Each repo indicates scope and mock/real integrations where applicable.

**How do I evaluate quickly?**  
Start with the README, then open the relevant one-pager in `docs/architecture/`, and check the demo matrix.

**Where are screenshots from?**  
Each project repo maintains its own assets; this portfolio mirrors known links for convenience.

**How is privacy handled?**  
One-pagers summarize privacy, redaction, and governance per project; see individual repos for full details.

**Can I get a printable summary?**  
Use `docs/README-PRINT.md`. For a PDF, generate via any Markdown to PDF tool or a CI step.

**Is there a live demo?**  
Links point to repo-level instructions. Where a live environment is not provided, walkthroughs and UI previews illustrate representative flows.
